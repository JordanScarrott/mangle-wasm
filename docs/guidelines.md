# Documentation guidelines

Documentation falls into four categories:

- learning-oriented tutorials
- goal-oriented how-to guides
- understanding-oriented discussions
- information-oriented reference material

We need all of these.

One design goal of Mangle is to distinguish between language specification
and its implementation(s). This distinction has the following benefits:

* It actually enables having multiple implementations.

* It help users understand the difference between language specification
 and implementation. This is not trivial.

* It helps users understand the concepts on an abstract level, independent
of any particular implementation. The slogan is "You can write Mangle in any
language."

## User docs at mangle.readthedocs.io

While a language specification and reference material need to be precise and
complete, user docs need to be approachable. For this reason, user documentation is
separated to [mangle.readthedocs.io](http://mangle.readthedocs.io),
with sources in the `readthedocs` directory.
