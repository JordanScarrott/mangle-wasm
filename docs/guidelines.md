# Documentation guidelines

Documentation falls into four categories:

- learning-oriented tutorials
- goal-oriented how-to guides
- understanding-oriented discussions
- information-oriented reference material

We need all of these.

One design goal of Mangle is to distinguish between language specification
and its implementation. This distinction has the following benefits:

* It actually enables having multiple implementations.

* It help users understand the difference between language specification
 and implementation. It is not trivial.

* It helps users understand the concepts on an abstract level, independent
of any particular implementation. The slogan is "You can write Mangle in any
language."

## Plan: Move user docs to readthedocs.io

Please do not link to github pages. User documentation will eventually move to
[http://mangle.readthedocs.io](http://mangle.readthedocs.io).
