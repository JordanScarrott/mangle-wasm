# Meta documentation

Documentation falls into four categories:

- learning-oriented tutorials
- goal-oriented how-to guides
- understanding-oriented discussions
- information-oriented reference material

We need all of these.

One goal of Mangle is to distinguish between language and its implementation.
Keeping these distinct serves two purposes:

* It actually enables having multiple implementations.

* It help users understand the difference between language specification
 and implementation.

* It helps understanding the concepts on an abstract level, independent
of any particular implementation. The slogan is "You can write Mangle in any
language."
